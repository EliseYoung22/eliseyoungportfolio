# Portfolio

This is a new Portfolio I created to replace the one I made in first term(https://github.com/EliseYoung22/CFA-Portfolio). I felt my original Portfolio did not reflect me very well and I was not satisfied with the quality of code so decided to build another one from scratch.

### Ideation
I was originally going to keep a similar layout from my previous Portfolio which had all the elements centered vertically but once I found the colour palette I didn't think it look good anymore so scrapped all my ideas and went for a more minimal approach.
